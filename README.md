# My works

This is a single page project made in Django. I created a navbar with two buttons that allows you to navigate between the Android games page and the 3D models page; this is done with the help of the index.js file.

In this project I used web scrapping with Python (BeautifullSoup) in order to get my latest 3D models from GrabCAD.

Note: I used Materialize as a CSS library.
